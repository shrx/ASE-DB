Phonon calculations
-------------------

This is the first piece of documentation for the new phonon module.
You can calculate the vibrational normal modes for a periodic system 
represented by an :class:`~ase.atoms.Atoms` object in the harmonic 
approximation using the :class:`~ase.phonons.Phonons`.
