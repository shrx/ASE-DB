Atomic Simulation Environment
=============================


The Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) is the common part of the
simulation tools developped at CAMd_.  ASE provides modules for moving
atoms, analyzing simulations etc.  For calculating energies and forces
on the atoms, ASE relies on a number of :mod:`ase.calculators`.  A calculator
may do a complete quantum-mechanical calculation, or may use a simpler
(semi-)empirical potential.
