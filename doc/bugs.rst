Bugs!
=====

If you find a bug in the CAMPOS software, please report it to the
developers so it can be fixed.  We need that feedback from the
community to maintain the quality of the code.

* If you are unsure if it is a real bug, or a usage problem, it is
  probably best to report the problem on the CAMPOS `Mailing
  list`_. Then we (or other users) can help you to find out if it is a
  bug.

  Another advantage of reporting bugs on the mailing list: Often other
  users will tell you how to work around the bug (until it is solved).

* If you think it is a bug, you can also report it directly on our
  Bugzilla `bug tracking system`_.  The advantage of reporting bugs
  here is that it is not forgotten (which may be a risk on the mailing
  list).

We do not guarantee to fix all bugs, but we will do our best.
